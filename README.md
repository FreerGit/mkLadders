# Mario Kart Ladder

A simple CRUD website to keep track over our Mario Kart games with a common ladder!

## How and Why 
Backend: Typescript, Express JS

Frontend: React, Server-side-rendering with Next JS, Material UI, Mongoose

Database: MongoDB

Why: Mostly just for fun but i also wanted to actually deploy a website with docker containers. The website is hosted on a EC2 in AWS.

## Install and run
once you've cloned the reposity run `npm i` root, frontend and backend directories. 
Then run `docker-compose build` in the root directory and lastly `docker-compose up`.

The website should then be reachable at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
